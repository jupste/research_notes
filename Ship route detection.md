# Ship route detection

- A vessel equipped with an AIS or VMS device broadcasts temporally ordered locations,  which  resemble  its  trajectory.  Intuitively,  the trajectories that are produced by vessels can be considered as time  sequence  data.
- Trajectories that are produced by vessels can be considered as time  sequence  data.  Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks have emerged as an effective technique for several difficult learning problems 
- AIS path prediction can be divided into four steps: create clusters based on historical data, classify new AIS data points using these clusters, create representative paths of the common behavior in route patterns and predict a vessel's future these paths.
- Possibility to suppress AIS data outliers in the manner of data compression?
- AIS data wrangling: denoise and then normalize via interpolation
- Anomaly course detection via Markov models
